  <h3>Answer Explanations:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>B – Apostrophe Misuse → "It’s" = "it is." Others misuse "its."</li>
    <li>A – Sentence Fragments → Complete sentence. B is a fragment.</li>
    <li>C – Degree of Comparison → "Smarter" is correct comparative.</li>
    <li>C – Subject-Verb Agreement → "The number" = singular → "is increasing."</li>
    <li>B – Dangling Modifier → Subject ("she") matches action.</li>
    <li>B – Redundancy → "Returned" already means "came back."</li>
    <li>B – Subject-Verb Agreement → "The group performs…" (singular).</li>
    <li>B – Word Usage → Correct is "He suggested that I join…"</li>
    <li>B – Active Voice → Clearer than passive versions.</li>
    <li>D – Redundancy / Wordiness → "The reason… is that…" is correct.</li>
